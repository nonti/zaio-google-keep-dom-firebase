# Google Keep with Firebase and ngrok Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a web application using Google Keep API, Firebase for authentication, and ngrok for URL redirect during development.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- Google Cloud Platform account with a project set up
- Firebase project created in the Google Cloud Platform console
- ngrok installed on your machine

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

3. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Google Cloud Platform Configuration

1. Enable Google Keep API in the Google Cloud Platform console.

2. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials for your web application.

3. Configure authorized redirect URIs for both local development and production environments.

## Firebase Configuration

1. Set up Firebase for authentication.

2. Configure Firebase to use Google as the authentication provider.

3. Configure Firebase Firestore for database storage if needed.

## Local Development

1. Start the development server.

```bash
npm start
```

2. Use ngrok to create a secure tunnel to your local development server.

```bash
ngrok http <port-number>
```

3. Update authorized redirect URIs in the Google Cloud Platform console to include ngrok's secure URL.

4. Update Firebase configuration to use ngrok's secure URL for redirecting.

## Deployment

1. Deploy your application to a hosting service.

2. Update authorized redirect URIs in the Google Cloud Platform console to include your production URL.

3. Update Firebase configuration to use your production URL for redirecting.

## Usage

1. Access the web application and authenticate using your Google account.

2. Use the Google Keep API to read, write, and manage notes.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation of each service (Google Cloud Platform, Firebase, ngrok) for troubleshooting steps.
